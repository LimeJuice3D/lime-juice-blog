title: Pursuit
---
For most of my life, I've kept myself entertained by making projects. While the programming and the cybersecurity are new pursuits, I was originally focused on 3D art as my passion. There's a lot of overlap; fundamentally, the two fields can be boiled down to reading documentation and watching youtube videos. But the reality is, it's difficult to go from something you can confidently say you know well, something you're beginning to find your niche in, to a new field where you're just as prone to the same mistakes, errors and learning pitfalls as everyone else. That's how my new cybersecurity course has felt to me. I've tried to excite an interest in this course; I've learnt a lot since the start of this year, and I hope that the break will really help me to build some of the coding projects I've been working on, but the reality is that I'm still a beginner. I'm fundamentally at the same level as most of my peers, which sounds normal but its still awkward to try and go from square one again. I suppose I'm not the only one who feels this way, anyone who does a second degree or some kind of career change would also feel this way, but that doesn't make it any less annoying.
